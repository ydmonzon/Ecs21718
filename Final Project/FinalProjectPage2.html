              <p>I was born in Guatemala and came to California when I was 3 years old. I lived in California with my grandma for 3 years. When I was 6 years old I moved to Chicago. I was always a bright person, I loved to go to school and made friends easily. I was an outgoing child. I was already walking when I was one year old. I've always been energetic. When I came to Chicago I started kindergarten, but I didn't know any English. When my parents came to Chicago, they didn't know English either. So they thought it would be smart to put me in a bilingual class, but apparently I was put into an all Englsih class. Things were honestly so hard for me, since I only knew Spanish. I was way out of my comfort zone. But I didn't give up, and eventually I learned to speak English and I'm fluent in it. I've had a lot of struggles growing up. At first it was hard to talk to people due to the fact that I didn't understand them. I grew up with my mom and a step dad. Although things were rough sometimes, I always kept positive.</p>

            <p> I have a really big family that's spread out all over, but in my household there's a total of five. It consists of my mom, my step dad, my two sisters, and I. I am the oldest of the three of us which can be a struggle but also has it's benefits. I don't really look like my sisters, due to the fact that we have different dads. Most of my family is in Guatemala, but I have some family in Kansas, New York, California, and many more places. In Chicago, other family members I know and are close with are my two aunts and my grandmother. We're all really close even though sometimes there are some arguements.We're always there for each other when needed or when things get rough. One thing my family is feels really strong about is pride; pride in what you believe in, pride in where you come from,etc. The bond that we all have is irreplaceable. We all might be a little crazy a My family is really supportive of me and believe I can do anything. They see such a bright future for me and I plan not to let them down.</p>
