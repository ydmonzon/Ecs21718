              <p>I was born in Guatemala and came to California when I was 3 years old. I lived in California with my grandma for 3 years. When I was 6 years old I moved to Chicago. I was always a bright person, I loved to go to school and made friends easily. I was an outgoing child. I was already walking when I was one year old. I've always been energetic. When I came to Chicago I started kindergarten, but I didn't know any English. When my parents came to Chicago, they didn't know English either. So they thought it would be smart to put me in a bilingual class, but apparently I was put into an all Englsih class. Things were honestly so hard for me, since I only knew Spanish. I was way out of my comfort zone. But I didn't give up, and eventually I learned to speak English and I'm fluent in it. I've had a lot of struggles growing up. At first it was hard to talk to people due to the fact that I didn't understand them. I grew up with my mom and a step dad. Although things were rough sometimes, I always kept positive.</p>
